This folder contains extra data and analysis produced for the paper, "**Modelling input-output relationships to optimize production of a live-attenuated malaria vaccine**". The goal of this repository is to further explain some of the steps taken towards the conclusions drawn in the Discussion section. This folder contains the following:

* **appendix.ipynb** - a Jupyter Notebook, written in Python; contains key data exploration with a focus on reproducibility.
* **graphs** - a folder containing graphs generated from **appendix.ipynb**.
* **data** - a folder containing the raw data from the conducted experiments.
